This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## WebFlix Entertainment.

This is my personal project using React, JavaScript, Redux, and CSS. I have created a movie/tv entertainment news and trailer site, complete with sign-in and sign-out features. 

## Objectives. :mega: :star:

This project was an attempt to practice new technologies recently learned such as Redux + hooks, react-router, and native JavaScript functionality such as local storage to create a sign-in feature.

This SPA routes between four different pages: home, movie search, tv show search, and about. I wanted to keep the site simple to hit my MVP in a reasonable time while getting a good amount of practice in with new tech learned.
